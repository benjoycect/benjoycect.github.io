        <title>Listen to &amp;quot;The Memory Palace&amp;quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always blown away at talks or articles that are able to take random moments in history and connect them to the present. One talk I saw that has stuck with me is Ethan Marcotte&amp;#39;s talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://aneventapart.com/event/austin-2013&quot;&gt;An Event Apart: Austin 2013&lt;/a&gt; called the &amp;quot;The Map &amp;amp; The Territory&amp;quot; (you can watch it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/120164988&quot; title=&quot;The Map &amp;amp; The Territory&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;). I wonder how great speakers find these moments in history that show the audience how the past can teach us about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have not learned how to take the time to read about our history. However, I just learned about Nate DiMeo&amp;#39;s podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thememorypalace.us/&quot; title=&quot;The Memory Palace&quot;&gt;The Memory Palace&lt;/a&gt;, because of their inclusion into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiotopia.fm/&quot; title=&quot;Radiotopia&quot;&gt;Radiotopia&lt;/a&gt; family. I&amp;#39;ve made it through 5 episodes and have already learned so much. Go listen if you want to be inspired by the past and figure out how it can change our future. They&amp;#39;re about 5 minutes. You have no excuse not to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything is Gone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pro-tip: Be super careful when using Git for the first time. Just felt the classic pain of deleting about 3 hours of work on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient person in me says it&amp;#39;s a learning experience. The patient person better get the hell out of this room.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello, benjaminjoyce.com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2015. It&amp;#39;s getting late and I have work tomorrow. Yet, I&amp;#39;m taking this time to launch a blog. Mine won&amp;#39;t be much different than the millions of others already on the internet. Yet, it&amp;#39;s a special moment for me. It&amp;#39;s not the first time I have launched a personal website. I first launched something back in 2010. That site, it&amp;#39;s content, and snapshot of that time is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those forgotten memories is why I write again today. I don&amp;#39;t want to forget. I want to look back at how bad of a writer I am. I want to see when I learned what I learned. This blog will have everything from CSS tips to personal achievements and failures. I am taking an oath not to delete my posts due to embarrassment, pressure, or other forces. Benjaminjoyce.com is a reflection of me, at the time of each post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I have for now.&lt;/p&gt;
