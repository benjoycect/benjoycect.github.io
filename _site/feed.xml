        <title>Hello, benjaminjoyce.com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2015. It&amp;#39;s getting late and I have work tomorrow. Yet, I&amp;#39;m taking this time to launch a blog. Mine won&amp;#39;t be much different than the millions of others already on the internet. However, it&amp;#39;s a special moment for &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not the first time I have launched a personal website. I first launched something back in 2010. However, that site, it&amp;#39;s content, and snapshot of that time is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those forgotten memories is why I write again today. I don&amp;#39;t want to forget. I want to look back at how bad of a writer I am. I want to see when I learned what I learned. It is my hope that this blog will have everything from CSS tips to personal achievements and failures. It is at this time that I am taking an oath not to delete my posts due to embarrassment, pressure, or other forces. Benjaminjoyce.com is a reflection of me, at the time of each post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I have for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ben&lt;/p&gt;
