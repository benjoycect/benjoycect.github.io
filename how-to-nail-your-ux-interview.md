I've been conducting interviews for various roles, particularly in creative and tech fields, for about fourteen years. In that time, I’ve seen interviews that truly shone and others that, well, missed the mark. These are tips from my perspective to help you show a hiring manager who you truly are, assess if you’re a fit for their team, and, just as importantly, whether their team is a fit for you.

## STAR: Showcase Your Experience

When I'm interviewing someone, I want to understand them first and foremost. To do that effectively, I want to hear about their specific role and contributions in past experiences. I've come across a framework called STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Hiring managers appreciate this approach because it provides concrete examples of your past behavior, offers a consistent way to evaluate candidates, and gives clear insight into your problem-solving skills and how you approach work.

When an interviewer asks a question that starts with "Tell me about a time when...", consider using the STAR framework. Here's an example to outline a response that effectively demonstrates this. Let's pretend the interviewer asked, "Tell me about a time when you had to work with a team."

### Situation:
First, set the scene. For example:

>"I was assigned to a project where we had to figure out how to increase the number of donations people who visited the non-profit's website made. It was an agile team that featured me as the designer, two developers, and two people who knew the business of the non-profit well."

This is really the setup for your story. It helps the interviewer understand the context of what you're about to tell them.

### Task:
Next, move on to your specific task within that situation. Even if the team accomplished great things together, the interviewer is most interested in hearing about how you specifically worked and contributed to that success.

An example task might be:

>"My specific role was to understand the users of the site, including their motivations and ability to donate to the non-profit. My task was to translate this research into an experience design, encompassing both the website and the offline experience, which encouraged and made it easier for people who wanted to donate to do so. It was up to me to help guide the team towards the best approach to the research and make sure that they understood everything so that we built the right solution for the right person."

At this point, the interviewer will have a good understanding of the context and your past roles beyond just the title on your resume.

### Action:
Now, you're ready to get into the body of your response – the actions you took.

>"I started by having the team go through exercises that helped us understand the problem more deeply. Since the two business members of the team felt like they had a good idea of the problem, it was a little hard to convince them that these activities would be valuable. However, after we went through them and they saw that they had gaps in their understanding, they were totally onboard. It also helped myself and the developers learn where we had to focus. Next, I created interview questions that we could ask users who fit the personas we developed during the initial exercises. One of the business members of the team facilitated the interviews with users we recruited through an online service – people who had visited the non-profit's site but did not donate. From these interviews, we were able to understand their motivations and develop a user journey map. The whole team went through what we had learned and developed a list of opportunities. I created wireframes for the parts that involved a UI and got those in front of more users with a quick and dirty task-based usability study. I made some adjustments, then I worked with the business team to create user stories that accurately matched what we had learned were customers' expectations. Those stories were executed on by the developers on the team, who made further recommendations that were well-informed and helped make the new donation experience even better."

The action part of the answer is a great time to show your work if possible. Provide artifacts that were produced as part of the process or point to how your actions influenced a live part of the design. Showing work is much more difficult under a non-disclosure agreement. I prefer when candidates can show me their work but totally sympathize when they can't. If they describe their work with enough detail, then I can usually get a sense of whether their approach would work well with my team.

### Result:
Finally, you're at the point where you should describe the results of your effort. Not all stories are tied to an immediate financial result, but they should be tied to something that is measurable.

For example, the result part of your response might sound like:

>"First, my effort to get the team involved with researching and understanding the people who are interested in the non-profit made it much easier for us to make decisions and support those decisions together when working with the non-profit board. We quickly went from forming to performing because we all worked toward a common, well-understood goal. Also, the non-profit is seeing strong returns from my design. Donations are up 20 percent through the website and surprisingly 15 percent through non-web means. The non-profit is now able to provide more services, and the board told our team that we would be leading more national-level efforts due to the success of our work with the donations."

It's not bragging when describing what you did or the results; it's providing facts. Don't try to minimize your efforts. Also, keep everything concise and on-point. Though the example above may read long, it is about two minutes in length when spoken at a comfortable speed. If you take the interviewer through this framework when they ask behavioral-based questions, then you'll get to present your best self and have them really understand what you're about.

## Don't Judge

This next point might seem straightforward, but it's crucial: don't judge your interviewer by their race, gender, age, way of talking, appearance, or really anything except the questions they are asking and the responses they give you. I'm young in appearance myself, and I've had instances where candidates, after what I thought was a good conversation, commented on my age to other interviewers and asked how I got into my position. Especially in fields like design, where understanding and empathy for people are paramount, any hint of discrimination is a significant red flag. It not only signals a potential mismatch for a collaborative, inclusive team but will also almost certainly undermine your chances of getting the job. Beyond the interview, striving to understand people better genuinely enriches your professional and personal life.

## Be Real

There is no reason not to be yourself in an interview. If you present a version of yourself that isn't true to who you are, you're ultimately disadvantaging both yourself and the business you're interviewing with. When you're authentic, your genuine strengths and personality can shine, leading to more natural conversations and helping you gauge if you’d truly be happy and thrive in that environment. This stage of the employee experience is all about finding the best mutual fit. If you don't present your true self, you risk ending up in a role or company culture that isn't right for you, and the company misses out on knowing the real you. So, while it's important to prepare well and get good rest the night before, ensure the "best self" you bring to the interview is your actual self.

## Ask Questions

I've hinted at this through the other tips, but interviews are as much about the company learning if you're a good fit for them as you finding out if the company is a good fit for you. Ask questions that you're genuinely curious about. Sometimes companies will shield you from their actual culture, perhaps unintentionally or by design. If you sense that they are hiding something or want to understand the reality of working there, ask questions that might be a little uncomfortable for them to answer. Just like you have to be your real self, encourage the interviewer to be their real self and share openly.

Consider asking about:

* **Team Dynamics & Collaboration:** "How does the team handle disagreements or conflicting ideas?" or "Can you describe the collaboration process on a typical project?"
* **Challenges & Growth:** "What are some of the recent challenges the team has faced, and how were they addressed?" or "What opportunities are there for professional development and learning in this role?"
* **Culture & Decision-Making:** "How are decisions typically made within the team or department?" or "What does success look like in this role, beyond the stated metrics?"

Thoughtful questions demonstrate your engagement and help you uncover whether the company is truly the right place for you.

## Final Thoughts

Navigating the interview process can be challenging, but by focusing on clearly communicating your experiences, being your authentic self, and actively engaging in the conversation, you can significantly improve your chances of not just landing a job, but landing the right job. Good luck!
