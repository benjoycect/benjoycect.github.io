I'm always blown away at talks or articles that are able to take random moments in history and connect them to the present. One talk I saw that has stuck with me is Ethan Marcotte's talk at [An Event Apart: Austin 2013](http://aneventapart.com/event/austin-2013) called the "The Map & The Territory" (you can watch it on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/120164988 "The Map & The Territory")). I wonder how great speakers find these moments in history that show the audience how the past can teach us about the future.

Unfortunately I have not learned how to take the time to read about our history. However, I just learned about Nate DiMeo's podcast, [The Memory Palace](http://thememorypalace.us/ "The Memory Palace"), because of their inclusion into the [Radiotopia](http://www.radiotopia.fm/ "Radiotopia") family. I've made it through 5 episodes and have already learned so much. Go listen if you want to be inspired by the past and figure out how it can change our future. They're about 5 minutes. You have no excuse not to.
