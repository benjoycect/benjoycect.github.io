I got some feedback today that made me want to share some of my visual design chops. I came up with a mobile game idea today. The game is called Huckle Buckle. It takes the concept of the "you're getting warmer" game and brings it to a grand scale. I still have to work out all the details, but basically there is a reward that is in an unknown location to the user. The user walks or runs around using the feedback from the game to get to the location of the reward. As they move the map is updated to show their route. Take a look and let me know what you think [@BenJoyceCT](https://twitter.com/BenJoyceCT)!
