I've started something new that has made life easier. The second I use a dish or silverware I wash it and put it back. It takes about two minutes and thirty seconds each time I hand wash the dishes from the previous meal. I've learned a valuable lesson from this new habit. It's a lesson that can be pulled directly from the lean manufacturing handbook: flow can work better than batch.

I'm not an expert on lean, but I want to recommend [lean.org](lean.org). It's not the best looking site I read, but it has some of the best content. It's a great place to start learning about lean. Actually implementing lean in any process is extremely hard. Even my little dish washing example takes a ton of mental effort to overcome the wonderful feeling of procrastination.

The best we can do is be prepared. Keep up the good work.
