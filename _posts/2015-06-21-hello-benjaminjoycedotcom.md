It's 2015. It's getting late and I have work tomorrow. Yet, I'm taking this time to launch a blog. Mine won't be much different than the millions of others already on the internet. However, it's a special moment for me. It's not the first time I have launched a personal website. I first launched something back in 2010. That site, it's content, and snapshot of that time is gone.

Those forgotten memories is why I write again today. I don't want to forget. I want to look back at how bad of a writer I am. I want to see when I learned what I learned. This blog will have everything from CSS tips to personal achievements and failures. I am taking an oath not to delete my posts due to embarrassment, pressure, or other forces. Benjaminjoyce.com is a reflection of me, at the time of each post.

That's all I have for now.

Edit 2015-08-16: I used the word "yet" multiple times in the first paragraph. I changed the word yet to the word however in the fifth paragraph.
