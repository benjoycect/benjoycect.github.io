It's 2015. It's getting late and I have work tomorrow. Yet, I'm taking this time to launch a blog. Mine won't be much different than the millions of others already on the internet. However, it's a special moment for **me**. It's not the first time I have launched a personal website. I first launched something back in 2010. However, that site, it's content, and snapshot of that time is gone.

Those forgotten memories is why I write again today. I don't want to forget. I want to look back at how bad of a writer I am. I want to see when I learned what I learned. It is my hope that this blog will have everything from CSS tips to personal achievements and failures. It is at this time that I am taking an oath not to delete my posts due to embarrassment, pressure, or other forces. Benjaminjoyce.com is a reflection of me, at the time of each post.

That's all I have for now.
