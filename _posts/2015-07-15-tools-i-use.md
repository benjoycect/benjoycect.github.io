I've tried all sorts of tools to help me save and organize links. Recently, I started using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com). The app has been around since 2007 (previously known as Read it Later). I'm happy to be a late adopter as it is now integrated into all the applications I could possibly imagine.

If you've ever wanted to save a link from [Twitter](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/482762-how-to-save-from-twitter-for-iphone), [Chrome](https://getpocket.com/chrome/), or any of the other [500 supported apps](https://getpocket.com/apps/), give Pocket a try.
